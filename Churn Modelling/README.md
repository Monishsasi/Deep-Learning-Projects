## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses.  
In this project, a machine learning pipeline is developed to:

- Analyze customer behavior
- Build a neural network classifier
- Evaluate churn prediction accuracy
- Visualize key metrics and patterns in the dataset
